Need approval to test TLS 1.3 adoption by middle-boxes in nightly.

Description:

After POSITIVE OKAY ("explicit yes") from y'all, we intend to ship a test of TLS 1.3 adoption by middle-boxes.

Population Affected:

1% of Nightly. All locales and user configurations.

Effect:

During the experiment, the values of ("security.tls.version.max", "security.tls.version.fallback-limit") preferences will be set to (4, 4), (4, 3), and (3, 3) in a random order. For each combination, we make XHR requests and record the results.

Cleanup:

In general, our experiment lasts for a short amount of time. Before starting the experiment, we store the default values for the aforementioned preferences, and restore them after the experiment is over. In presence of a crash or an unprecedented incident, the preferences will be restored to their default values after browser startup since we do not modify them permanently.

Goals:

We are planning to identify the machines that face failed connections when TLS 1.3 is enabled. This most likely happens due to presence of middle-boxes that interfere with the user's HTTPS traffic. In case of failure, we collect error messages in order to understand what went wrong.
